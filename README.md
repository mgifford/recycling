# Recycling: Collecting ideas to encourage recycling

Waste is defined as:
- the garbage we send to landfill and
- the recycling we re-process into useful materials

Three steps to conducting an audit:
Step 1 - Visual Garbage audit of the contents of all the garbage cans
Step 2 - Visual Recycling audit of the contents of all the recycling bins
Step 3 - Visual review of green bins.

## Safety First!
Health and Safety tips while conducting the visual waste audit:
• Do not open bags of garbage or recycling! This is a visual audit using clear bags
and visual estimation.
• Have some extra bags on hand in case of a tear in collection bags.
• Do not eat or drink while conducting the waste audit.
• Have some hand sanitizer available.

## Waste Audit Tips
Start off each fiscal year with a waste audit:
• Do both Step 1: Visual Garbage Audit and Step 2: Visual Recycling Audit on the same day. This will save set up time.
• Choose a ‘typical’ day for your audit—not one that has any special events. 
• Don’t tell people about the audit. You’ll get more accurate data.
• Complete a second audit in the spring and compare the results.

## Step 1 - Visual Garbage Audit
In order to assess your garbage, you will need to gather all the garbage for a 24 hour period, then:
a. Weigh the garbage (do not empty liquids)
b. Perform a visual audit of the contents of the bags of garbage

### Materials needed
• Clear plastic garbage bags to hold the entire organization's garbage for a day. Make sure you have enough bags so that the bags will be only half- full. This makes it easier to weigh and estimate the contents.
• Garbage – It may be easiest to schedule your audit the day after garbage pickup so only one day’s worth of garbage has accumulated. For example, if the garbage pickup takes place on Tuesday morning, designate Tuesday’s garbage as your audit material and begin your audit Wednesday morning.
• Hanging spring/digital scale – Your board’s waste coordinator, the custodian, or the science department may have one.
• Reference sheet of what is recyclable in your board or region. Ask your custodian or principal for the official list/poster.
• Worksheet – Garbage Audit Worksheet(s)
• Clipboard
• Pen
• Camera to record your audit (optional)

### Instructions
1. Gather your garbage for a 24 hour period. Make sure the garbage is put into clear plastic garbage bags. The bags should only be half-filled because this will make it easier to assess the contents of the bags.
2. Weigh each bag and record the mass on the worksheet.
3. Complete a visual audit by examining the contents
of each bag. You are looking for five categories of waste (see Estimating percentages for instructions). Carefully roll the bag around, talk with your fellow auditors about the contents, and estimate the percentages of the contents!
4. For each bag, estimate the volume in percent
of each of the different waste categories. Record your estimates and observations.
5. When you have assessed all of the bags, calculate the average volume for each of the five categories.
6. Calculate the amount of garbage per person per year using the worksheet.
7. When you have completed the audit make sure the garbage gets put where it will be picked up.
8. Communicate your results and reduction strategies with the whole organization. Consider
sharing your audit results at an assembly, through announcements, or with posters.

### Estimating Percentages
Instructions: Examine the contents of each clear garbage bag; estimate the percentages that make up recyclable containers, paper, food, and garbage.

## Step 2 - Visual Recycling Audit
Repeat the Visual Garbage Audit instructions using all the recycling collected over a 24 hour period and the Recycling Audit Worksheet(s)

## Step 3 - Waste Minimization Action Plan
1. Based on your data and observations from the Garbage Audit Worksheet and Recycling Audit Worksheet, identify the most common items found in the waste produced by your organization.
1. Identify items in the waste and recycling streams that can be targeted as items to be reduced and brainstorm strategies to accomplish this goal. It is often easiest to target items that can be replaced by a reusable container or that are highly visible (e.g., single use water bottles).
1. Record your strategies in the Waste Minimization Action Plan or refer to your board’s master Waste Reduction Plan if available.
1. Communicate the results of your audit and the strategies from your Waste Minimization Action Plan to the organization. This can be done by hosting an assembly the day after your audit, creating posters depicting the results, or launching a campaign to reduce a specific item in the waste stream. Post your waste audit data and Waste Minimization Action Plan where everyone can see it.

## What’s Important?
Reduction! Doing a waste audit can help identify what your team can target to reduce its overall waste. Finding out what contaminates your recycling stream can also help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your recycling efforts.
